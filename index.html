                The UN's sustainable development goal nr. 4 states that they aim to "Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all."
                Quality education for all is a goal almost on par with ending poverty, hunger and preventable illnesses. Eduacation is the cornerstone of progress, 
                and with it, many more will be able to help themselves.

                So why school-buses? Well, we found that by offering a means of transportation to and from school, we could both encouage students to attend, and make school more accessible to those
                living a long distance from the nearest school. By making eduaction easier to access, we could ensure a higher rate of atendance, and eventually literacy and numeracy as well.
                The buses would be solar powered and electrical to help move towards other SDGs such asaffordable and clean energy. You can read more about this <a href="AbtBus.html">here</a>
