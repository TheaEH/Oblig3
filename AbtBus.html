<p class="bus-p">Buses have long been a part of the busy day to day life of many
    people. Some take the bus to get to work, others to school.
    Many countries even have school busses arranged to pick children up
    so that they can get to school.
   In developing countries, there is a lack of funding for
    school. They might not be able to afford electric charging stations
    stations, and normal busses pollutes the air. However,
    there exists busses with solar panels on their roof,
    which allows them to recharge everytime the sun shines!
Now If one were to place out such busses in
    different regents of developing countries, they could be used to
    transport children to school and back to aid them in getting an education.
