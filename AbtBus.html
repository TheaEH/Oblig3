        <h2>About buses</h2>
        <p class="bus-p">Buses have long been a part of the busy day to day life of many
            people. Some take the bus to get to work, others to school.
            Many countries even have school buses arranged to pick children up
            so that they can get to school. <br>
            In developing countries, there is a lack of funding for
            school. They might not be able to afford electric charging stations
            stations, and normal buses pollute the air. However,
            there exists buses with solar panels on the roof,
            which allows them to recharge everytime the sun shines! <br>
            Now If one were to place out such buses in
            different regents of developing countries, they could be used to
            transport children to and from school, and aid them in getting an education.
